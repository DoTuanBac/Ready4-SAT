        content: "Nearly anyone can qualify for scholarships for college students, including high school, community college students, and transfer students. In addition, you can apply for scholarships at any point during your college career. So if you’re struggling to make ends meet during the final semester of your senior year, you still have options open to you. \n" +
            "\n" +
            "Criteria to apply varies, but may include an online registration form, transcript submission, or a personal essay. You may have to submit a video where you go into detail about yourself and your ambitions. Some scholarships are done by lottery drawing, meaning you only have to meet some basic eligibility criteria to be entered into the pool. Those who determine winners are usually looking for the most promising candidates. From your GPA to your community efforts, the idea is to showcase your best qualities in their required format.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "For example the J&Y Law offers a $1,000 scholarship for college freshmen. It's called the Defense Against Distracted Driving Scholarship. This is nonrenewable, meaning you’ll receive it once during your college career, as opposed to each year you enroll. To qualify, you must write an essay that details how you handle distracted driving. There is one recipient for this annual award.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "You can also look into the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This form can help you qualify for additional student aid from the federal government. Your state may also consider FAFSA when it comes to who is eligible and how much each person should receive.",

        title: "Score an SAT vocab victory",
        content:"If anything, knowing the definitions of vocabulary words is almost more important on the Writing section (well, okay, it’s as important) as knowing it on the Reading section. Why? Because here, you’re asked to select the best word for a given context. You’re not looking for a synonym; instead, you’re going to find the best word to create the desired meaning.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "While this may seem like it’s about grammar rather than vocabulary, it’s actually not. In the College Board’s words,\n" +
            "\n" +
            "“It’s worth noting here that these language use questions aren’t directly about grammar, usage, or mechanics. Instead, these questions try to get you to think about how language should be used to accomplish particular writerly aims, such as being clearer, more precise, or more economical.”",

        title: "6 ways college is different from high school",
        content:"It's hard to know what college is really like until you get there. And in these uncertain times, college life might be even more difficult to imagine. But no matter when or where your freshman year begins -- at home, on campus, or some combination of the two -- college will be different from high school in these important ways.\n" +
            "1. Time in college is managed by you, not the school.\n" +
            "One of the biggest challenges for new college freshmen is time management. Most students are surprised by the amount of \"free\" time they have compared to their lives in high school. In college, you may have three classes one day, and none the next. You might be tempted to kick back, but it's up to you to balance studying and coursework with socializing and other pursuits. \n" +
            "\n" +
            "2. College professors expect you to learn and think independently.\n" +
            "As a college freshman, you will be responsible for your learning. You’ll be expected to cover course material on your own with less hand-holding by professors and instructors than you might have experienced in high school. It’s common for some professors to assign material not covered in lectures (and to include that material in exams) and to call on you to explain readings, contribute to discussions, and debate key points.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "At the same time, college professors are there to help and they want you to succeed. However, you will need to be proactive and reach out to them. It will be up to you to email instructors and visit their office hours, and to seek out academic services at the college, such as tutoring or study groups. Many of the students featured in CollegeData’s Road to College Student stories say that attending office hours and taking advantage of their college’s academic resources helped them succeed.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "3. Cramming at the last minute doesn't work.\n" +
            "Some high school students are successful with last-minute studying. But exams in college are generally given less frequently, cover more material and are more difficult than high school tests. College exams often require in-depth and thoughtful answers that demonstrate your mastery of the content. As many freshmen learn the hard way, this means you need to consistently keep up with your studies and coursework and not wait until the last minute to study for a test.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "4. Your social life is wide open.\n" +
            "If you are living on campus or away from home, you may feel like a bird let out of a cage when you arrive on campus. You’ll meet many new people—and you’ll be able to do what you want when you want. But with this new freedom comes the responsibility to set priorities and boundaries, including balancing studying and course work with non-academic pursuits.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "5. You might be sharing a (very small) personal space with a stranger.\n" +
            "Even if you're used to sharing a room with a sibling, living with someone you’ve never met can be a challenge. You'll need to negotiate everything from \"lights out\" time to what's considered “personal space” and \"neat.\" Your roommate may not be your best friend. However, a roommate can be a familiar face as you settle into college.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "6. From money to moods, you'll be responsible for taking care of yourself.\n" +
            "Like many students facing a new and unfamiliar experience, you might hit some rough patches in college. It might be difficult to make friends, or you might be disappointed in your course grades. It’s easy to over-extend yourself socially or make mistakes managing your money. Many college freshmen come to a point where they may need to assess their priorities, and in some cases, make some changes.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Fortunately, most colleges provide resources to help students adjust to college life. These include health care professionals, mental health services, and academic and career counselors. But taking steps to get on track will be up to you.",

        title: "The caries thing about SAT test day (and how to overcome them)",
        content: "For more tips on how to study and manage your time, see these ideas from fellow students:\n" +
            "Diagnose your skills early on. Even if you don’t plan on studying during the months leading up to the SAT, we advise you to take a diagnostic on Khan Academy, or complete the PSAT/NMSQT, six months before the test. That way, you’ll have a good sense of how close you are to your SAT goal. If you have a lot of skills to learn, you might want to start studying earlier than you’d planned. Fariha suggests: “Figure out what areas you need to focus on the most, and keep practicing. Don't get discouraged if at first it is difficult to understand or learn, the more you practice the easier it will get.”\n" +
            "Take at least two full practice tests. We recommend taking at least one fully-timed practice test toward the beginning of your studying, and one toward the end. We also recommend you take at least one practice test on paper, which is how the actual SAT is administered, so you can get comfortable with the format. Taking a full-length practice test provides a realistic sense of how long the test is and where you tend to get tired or mentally blocked. Yes, it’s at least three hours of hard work, but if your first full SAT is on Test Day, you may find yourself unpleasantly surprised by how taxing all of that intense thinking can be. You can't train for a marathon just by doing sprints! Gaeun says: “Full practice tests are invaluable. Taking at least two before the actual test helps you gain some sense of what it's like to sit for four hours taking the SAT. Timing yourself strictly and accurately is essential when taking these tests.”\n" +
            "Familiarize yourself with the instructions for each test section. The sequence of the sections and the directions for each section will be the same for every SAT. Time that you spend trying to understand the instructions on Test Day is time wasted. Hannah says: “If I take the SAT again … I would want to better know what would be expected of me on the writing portion, by looking at some kind of rubric or other guide.”\n" +
            "Study outside the box. Mix up your SAT prep with some general skill building. Read and summarize long articles and scientific studies to prepare for the Reading Test. Read editorial articles or essays and pay attention to how the writer constructs his or her argument to prepare for the optional essay. These approaches may not be enough on their own, but there’s no more sure way to reinforce a skill and build your understanding than to apply what you know to the real world. Eric advises: “Don't underestimate the power of reading books. Reading in bulk not only increases your world knowledge and cultural awareness, but it also helps exercise your brain to pick up on finer details and make extrapolations based on context. It will make the critical reading and writing sections more enjoyable and allow you to think clearer. Read often, read lots.”\n" +
            "Take a break the night before the test. We know this can be hard advice to follow—why would you waste any critical study time right before the SAT? But it’s important to make sure you’re rested and relaxed when you wake up for the test. Studying at the last minute can introduce extra stress, lower your confidence, and wear you out. Instead, we recommend you do something calm and enjoyable, like watching a favorite movie or playing soccer with friends, to take your mind off the test and put yourself in a good mood. David says: “Please, do not study the SATs the night before the exam! Our neurons need some rest too.”\n" +
            "Set yourself up for success on Test Day. What everyone says is true—a good night’s sleep can make all the difference. Make sure you go to bed early the night before the test and clock a full night of sleep (at least 8 hours). It may help to go to bed a little earlier every night the week before the test so an early bedtime on Friday feels natural. Wake up early on Saturday so you have plenty of time to warm up your brain before the SAT starts, and eat a full, healthy breakfast so you’re not distracted by hunger or discomfort during the test. And don’t forget to organize your supplies in advance! You’ll need No. 2 pencils and a calculator to take the test, and you will not be allowed into the test room without a valid photo ID and a printed copy of your SAT test registration. The more you do to feel prepared and rested before the SAT, the more you’ll be able to focus on success while taking the test. Rushi says: “Try to get as much sleep as possible before the exam. You're most likely already prepared, and the extra sleep will help you think properly during the SAT.”",
